## 0.0.1

When your app is opened, there is a brief period while the app loads. 
By default, during this time, the app displays a white splash screen. 
This package will help you add a customized splash screen, allowing you to include your 
own background image and logo. It also features a one liner progress loader that indicates the loading progress,
enhancing the user experience. Once the splash screen loads completely, 
you can navigate to the next screen using the navigateToNextScreen callback function
